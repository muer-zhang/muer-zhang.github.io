          What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
        </h3>
        <p class="question-answer">My long term goal is work in web development or adjacent tech roles.	
        </p>
        <P class="question-answer">I will value and fully utilise my time in Dev Academy to learn the basics of technical software developing skills, as well as soft skills especially problem solving skills.
          At the end of the course, I would like myself to be able to think like a developer, to accept the limitation of own knowledge and to keep learning.

          A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning
        </h3>
        <p class="question-answer">
          Strengths:
I am cheerful and positive with my learning in this new career path.  I am hard working and can work wisely by knowing how to prioritize.  I may feel stuck sometimes during my learning but I know when to ask for help or how to get myself to reflect and relax again. 
        </p>
        <P class="question-answer">Limitations:
          This course requires us to get actively involved in discussions and activities via the Slack app.  I might be a bit reserved when it comes to share thoughts and talking about myself.  But I would like to meet and know these lovely like minded people.  I am willing to step out and I did my first introduction on Slack. It felt great.
          </P>

This should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you
      
        </h3>
        <p class="question-answer">
          During the five weeks of foundation period, I will plan at the beginning of the day, follow my plan and timeboxes.  At the end of the day, I will do a reflection of what I have learned and something interesting.  I will keep checking on my Slack channels, asking questions if I am stuck or answering otherâ€™s queries if I know.  I have already had my first check in with my facilitator Naomi on my week 1.  I have next four check in booked already on every Thursday.  


        </p>
        <P class="question-answer">I use the Toggle app everyday now.  After every 45 minutes of study, I will have a 15 minutes of break.  If I am stuck with something, I will try to figure it out myself first, through the handbook, google, Slack etc.  There are lots of options for seeking help.  I will also remind myself be optimistic and enjoy the learning path. 
        </P>

        </h3>
        <p class="question-answer">
          In order to keep up with the timeboxes and learning schedule,  if I come across any problems, I will give myself half an hour to solve.  But if after half an hour, I am still stuck with it.  Then it is time to seek help.  I could post in Foundation channels in Slack, or even ask my facilitator.
