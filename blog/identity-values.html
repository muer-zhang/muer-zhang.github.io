          With my previous work, we needed to work as a team together. Teamwork
          is important. However, there were scenarios that some team members may
          pick and choose what they prefer to do instead of checking the
          workflow and the team. This is not fair and inefficient for the whole
          team. In order to solve this, I suggested to have a catch up and to
          allocate work to each team members at the beginning of the day. If
          everyone agrees, itâ€™s great. If not, we solve it right away. This
          really helps making the day flow smoothly.

          I grew up in a family surrounded by my lovely family and friends.
          Everyone in the family takes care of each other, trust and respect
          others. My dad is a hard working person. And he spends time with us
          whenever he can. My mum looks after us and she is always there when we
          need her. We have a positive attitude towards life and challenges
          because there is always support behind us.

          Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and
          career development.

        <p class="question-answer question-answer1">
          Strengths: I am cheerful and positive with my learning in this new
          career path. I am hard working and can work wisely by knowing how to
          prioritise. I may feel stuck sometimes during my learning but I know
          when to ask for help or how to get myself to reflect and relax again.
        </p>
        <p class="question-answer">
          Limitations: This course requires us to get actively involved in
          discussions and activities via the Slack app. I might be a bit
          reserved when it comes to share thoughts and talking about myself. But
          I would like to meet and know these lovely like minded people. I am
          willing to step out and I did my first introduction on Slack. It felt
          great.

          the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and
          your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
        </h3>
        <p class="question-answer">
          Let me share a recent example from work. I was assigned to train a new
          staff at work. There were a lot to learn and remember, hence it was a
          bit overwhelmed at the beginning. I understood that because I went
          through that stage as well. 
        </p>
          <p class="question-answer">
          In order to work productively we need to
          know how to prioritize work flow. We sometimes would come across
          specimens that require trouble shooting before we could process them
          to the next stage. One day we came across a specimen that was
          unlabelled. My colleague was very interested to address the problem
          straight away. But I suggested that she could carry on with other
          specimens and leave that problematic specimen for later due to the
          current work flow. 
        </p>
          <p class="question-answer">
          It was an effective decision. After an hour or so,
          we finished processing the rest of the specimens and we had half an
          hour gap to do a catch up. I used my time to explain the whole trouble
          shooting procedure and she gave it a go. At the same time, we were not
          delaying other work. 
        </p>
          <p class="question-answer">
          We did a reflection at the end of the day. My
          colleague learned something new and also understood more about
          prioritizing work flow. I was also doing reflections on my own and I
          would like to adjust my training focus to look at the big picture in
          the team environment. As my new colleague learn more, the focus for
          her would be able to constantly check her surroundings and to start
          making decisions of what to prioritize. This is a very important and
          efficient skill to work together in a team.
